frk is an experimental parallel Mandelbrot and Julia fractal sets generator 
written as my first Erlang application.

frk requires the Erlang environment (I used the release R13B03 under
GNU/Linux Ubuntu 10.10).

The bash shell scripts (alfa version):

- frkMandelbrot.sh
- frkJulia.sh

Require ImageMagick (I use the 6.6.2-6) to convert trivial PPM to 
PNG format (or other formats).

Use -h argument for more information or generate the default 
image calling them without arguments. All generated images
will be saved into save directory.
